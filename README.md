# Aviation Accident Analysis

The purpose of this project is to analyze airplane safety based on a number of factors. The analysis is conducted on a data set of aviation accident data from 1948-2003.

## Data Cleaning
The notebook Avaiation_Accidents_Cleaning contains all of the steps used to clean and filter the data in AviationData.csv. This includes filtering the data to professionally-built airplanes from the last 40 years. This also includes removing data that is unnecessary for this analysis or has too many missing values to be useful, as well as additional cleaning and consolidation tasks.

The cleaned data set is created as CleanAviationData.csv to be used in subsequent analysis.

## Data Analysis
Details will be added once this part of the project is underway.
